# burger
making a full stack app for practice that involved a list with burgers to eat. First deployed full stack application!

## Getting Started
A deployed version of the app can be found here https://mighty-journey-36259.herokuapp.com/.

## Usage

After navigating to the site you will be greeted with two lists of burgers with buttons to "devour" and "buy more" buttons. Selecting one will change the value in the database and move it to the other list.

## Packages
